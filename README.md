<h1 align="center"> üí∏üèôÔ∏è Cost of living üèôÔ∏èüí∏ </h1>


## Project overview

This project is a collaborative effort by a group of 4 developers in order to create an application that solves a real-world problem. We chose to create a website that generates information about cost of living in different cities around the world.
In today‚Äôs economy, we all understand that budgeting is even more important. We hope to help those looking for a change to a different city by providing the most up to date information on the cost of living there.
With each new search, each refresh, our site fetches data relevant to the city searched with the most up-to-date pricing information available.

## Technologies used and why

For this project we used technologies as HTML, CSS and Bootstrap to create the interface, Javascript to add more interaction with the user.

## Challenges for future improvement

As with any new group project, it takes some time to get to know your team members and be able to collaborate and come to solutions. Our skill levels and knowledge bases are different so to be able to come together and input our  work in this project was a challenge we worked though.
As most students in this class, we are all working full-time along with this Bootcamp so setting ample time to discuss or correspond was a challenge outside of class.
Constant communication and time management were two important skills that assisted us during this project.
Some challenges experienced with regards to the technologies used in this project were the correct application of APIs and molding our project to best incorporate them. Selecting styling for our webpage was another challenge as we had a few options we could finalize on.

## The Requirements

This project consists in creating a application that the user can navigate, and understand better the cost of living in different cities around the world. The main requirements for this projects are:

- Using a CSS framework other than bootstrap
- Use at least two [server-side APIs](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/apis/api-resources).
- Does not use alerts, confirms, or prompts (use modals.)
- Use client-side storage to store persistent data.
- Be responsive.
- Have a polished UI.
- Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).
- Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).

## The Project

- Our website is a cost of living database which allows you to search quality of life data: Buy Apartment, Childcare, Clothing, Markets Rent Per Month, Restaurants, Salaries And Financing, Sports And Leisure, Transportation and Utilities Per Month.
- The purpose of our project is to help out a user when budgeting in this economy is essential to surviving and with the breakdown of all potential costs in a big move, we hope to give some clarity to the user.
